    <h2><em>Seven Eyes, Seven Horns</em></h2>
    <div style="max-width: 800px;">
        <p>There’s a creeping horror. A rumbling echo, rolling beneath your feet. There’s a sweetness on your tongue, a souring honey, pepper cherry jam. You hear a bard and his lute and you remember watching <em>Narnia</em> for the first time in your first home. </p>
        <p>You are filthy and rotten. There might be suffering at the Earth’s core or among the dying stars. Is hell above or below you?</p>
        <p>A whispered prayer escapes aching lips, an oath to an entity you don’t believe in.</p>
        <p>The air is stale and the coyotes yelp. They die with a whimper, just like T.S Eliot said they would. 
            The stars are falling and you can’t hear them. You can’t smell them, you can’t see them, but maybe you can feel them. 
            You are a mockery of their heat.
            </p>
            <p>The Wikipedia entry for “Events of Revelation” is open in your hands. </p>
            <p>But you hear no trumpets, the Earth bears no quiver.
                There is no beast. 
                Only you, beneath a flickering farmhouse light, listening to the drone of our aching planet.
                Your shoulders never ease from what seems to weigh as much as a lifetime. 
                </p>
            <p>You’d never know it, 
                but a lamb was just born in the field, who’s first and last sight will be an already emptying night sky. </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px"> <em>How tragic</em> </p>
            <p> To never have traced constellations.</p>
        </div>
        <div style= "text-align: right;">
            <h3>dream journal 1</h3>
            <p>I had a dream last night that you embraced me<br>And I bit down on your wool sweater
            <br>It drowned out the sobs that I wanted you to hear.
            <p>I almost gagged, my jaw grew sore <br>My mouth itched and it tickled my tongue<br>I'm sorry about the mess.</p>
          </div>

            <h2><em>My Crystal Ball Broke Years Ago</em></h2>
            <pre>
The leaves shake like glittering sequins 
Barely holding on 
The low sky hangs gray, and I feel every nuanced ache 
In my hunched back 
My shoulders stretch

I’m itching to meet a psychic
To sit in a plastic beach chair 
Sun bleached and sticky with sweat, baking in an overgrown garden
I’d rather be camping!

My fingers twitch looking for something to hold 
Uneasy and missing the weight of something
Playing cards? A drink? Maybe the pocket knife my father bought me. 

I have scoliosis that we never found the time to address
My grandmother has it worse. 
My mother seems to worry about us both. 
She says we argue with her the same.

My back eases and contorts
Slotting itself between pangs of pain  
I wait patiently.
