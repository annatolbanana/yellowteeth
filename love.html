        <h3><em>Bleh!</em></h3>
        <p>
            I think in another life you’re a swaying bending arching oak tree<br>
I think in another life I’m the knots in your branches or the crawling moss at your base<br>
Or maybe we’re two tall pines, so broad that a circle of stars grasping hands could encircle us <br>
Maybe we send silent radio waves between our roots <br>
Maybe dinosaurs fell in love under our branches <br>
Maybe they fought and slept and ate <br>
Maybe the smoke from the impact clouded their eyes <br> 
Turned the sun a bright orange <br>
Attacked their lungs and veins and heart and maybe they rocked away to sleep<br>
Under our intertwined branches <br>
Maybe it snowed and you laughed at me just like you did last January <br> </p>
<p>
Maybe that was it, maybe we were never branches or leaves or a forest<br>
Maybe all we had was kicking ice sheets and giggling through frosted lashes <br>
I wonder if the dinosaurs brought each other snow dampened flowers

        <h3>Untitled</h3>
        <p>Every crease of my skin sticks to itself<br>
            Strangers that I love, all around me taking drags from shared cigarettes<br>
            Clouds of unionizing smoke hang thickly <br>
            and yet I am skin to skin with milk drenched memories</p>
        <p>
            <em>“Would you like to partake?”</em> I shake my head <br>
<em>“No thank you”</em>
        </p>
        <p>I remember when you touched my bare legs for the first time. <br>
            My chest and my waist. <br>
            My hips– I’m sure you could recognize my hip bones out of a line up <br>
            Maybe only your lips could</p>
        <p>I want to jar your love, let it stew and bubble and curdle over a stovetop <br>
            I want to gulp it down, let my palms soak in it. <br>
            I want you to keep me warm from the inside out <br>
            just as you once had:</p>
        <p>in your bed <br>
        against the wall <br>
        on the floor <br>
        in your chair <br>
        on the sink </p>
        <p><em>We laughed</em></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">I'm unsewing myself-- my fingers: my seam rippers</p>
        <p><em>It's getting cold and its time to walk back inside</em></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Does my lamp still light your room from your bedside?</p>

        <h3> Prayer to all the beds I've slept in that weren't mine</h3>
        <h5>Written for Jacob's final for a class I wasn't in that I never got to see </h5>
        <h6>shrug</h6>
        <pre>
I remember your smell, how you felt across my skin
Grant me grace
Grant me kindness, your glimmers of sincerity 

I pray to the beds I’ve slept in, 
Beds that aren’t mine– flickering comfort and brief, whole, translucent understanding

To be let in, to be vulnerable, how kind. 
Under slotted moonlight, maybe besides a bedside lamp
Or a cat tree, or maybe nothing at all. 

Whispering to me,
	Like I’d wish the stars would
Answering me,
	Like I’d wish Capital G God would 

Let me float, face down, in the lake of your cotton
	One last time (again and again)
Though, this time I may not make it to shore.

I pray I find you again, over and over
Maybe the scent will be different, maybe I’ll retch
An experience just as revered

You’re much realer to me than the cosmos
Or the depths of the sea

How intense is this need
This yearning to be held, felt, and seen
By the unanimity that is someone else’s bed. 

May each bed grant another page turning
Another line of mine read, alongside another instance of my dreaded truth 
Of Softly brushing our teeth in well loved pajamas, side by side
Or of drunkenly stripping one another 
Or of softly weeping

May I never stop leaving another bed in another room with the memory of my presence 
Allow me to forever stamp the routines of others with my outline
May I never stop the search for theirs in mine

        <h3>You Are Here!</h3>
        <p>The stars hold hands and they might’ve already died<br> 
            They might have burned up before we were tall <br>
            When we lived across the country, under the same moon and stars <br>
            Parallel, unknowing lives <br> <br>
            
            Maybe we spied on the same constellations <br> 
            Tumbled and giggled under the same summer skies <br>
            Watching the sun trail across the same path, three hours apart <br>
            
            Maybe we’d innocently hold hands, just like our dying stars <br>
            Unaware of the same gods, dancing under our light <br>
            Small and innocent <br>
            With missing teeth, collecting rolly pollies, on bandaged knees <br> <br>
            
            When friendship simply meant knowing the same words <br>
            And living on the same street <br> <br>
            
            How lucky I am to have met you <br>
            How lucky I have been to have known you <br>
            How cruel the stars are, for not introducing us sooner <br>
            How cruel of the stars, for not letting us stick <br>
            Like the drying rolly pollies, to the airtight tupperware I housed them in <br> 
            Unknowing of living breath. </p>

            <h3>Love Letter #6</h3>
            <p>You feel like my father and have his laugh<br>
                You should be flattered, and I might melt <br>
                You look like my father <br>
                Let that sit<br>
                I fold you quietly, so you can’t make a sound<br>
                A photo in my wallet, velvet in the night<br> 
                A coffee ring<br>
                You look like my father and itch like a sneeze and<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wait for your hands <br><br>
                
                My love pins you up on my jet plane <br>
                I die at war <br><br>
                
                You don’t visit the ivory
                </p>

                <h3>Growing Pains</h3>
                <p>I can’t help, but apologize <br>
                    For the taut skin pulled over elbows<br>
                    Bloodied knees and sweaty smalls of backs <br>
                    I’m sorry for making a scene and I’m sorry for the pit in your stomach<br><br>
                    
                    Sometimes it seems like it’s all coming undone. <br>
                    I forget what I said that ruined it all <br>
                    I Frankensteined the best of our lives<br><br>
                     
                    I beckon it back <br>
                    As I watch through barn peep holes <br>
                    Learning French from the lullabies you sing to the ones you really love<br><br>
                    
                    <em>Maybe-</em> <br>
                    I could stitch together a love <br>
                    That peeks back
                    </p>
                    <pre>

                    <h3>Happy Tail Syndrome</h3>
                    <p>In my dreams I marry. Somewhere in the mountains, no wedding, just a ceremony. You love me kindly as you naturally always have. I do everything in my power to return the beautiful kindness. In my dreams it works. We’re truthful and headstrong, smart and wonderful. You read about the world, its histories and its futures, I talk about painting. I’m not sure if I do. I’m forever in awe of you. Like a dog of its man. </p>
