        <h3>September 13</h3>
        <pre>
There are some days, where if you look up, you feel the 
sky above you and the jewel green leaves funneling soft 
gentle light, where you feel a mild warmth, and you remember
walking to the park behind the first house you ever lived 
in. The sky takes on such a specific blue hue; a tint, tone, 
and shade, that tells you it remembers you. It remembers when 
you had kitchen scissor bangs, fleshy palms and knees. It 
remembers when you caught spiders and snakes between dry,
dusty, golden paths. Watching you stand on the tips of 
uncoordinated toes to peek over fence posts. 

Some days, the sky recognizes you despite growing taller 
and sadder. Miles and miles away from what it knows to be
Home. And you see how the sky loves the painted towers you 
watch, how it paints the bricks, windows, streets, and trees 
as if this strange world is its most natural muse. Hand painted 
faces, painted like calm waters will smooth over stone. This isn’t 
home but there is room for so much love. Just as you loved the 
outreaching grass, the spider bites, and splinters. The cows on 
the hills and the forest fires. There are no forest fires here, 
and maybe that fills you with unease. Maybe you miss the smoke 
in your backyard. At least you were held in the palms of the 
rolling hills you’ve always known. Now you’re here, and you can’t 
trust the recognizing sky. 

Maybe that’s who God is, maybe that’s who I’ve been speaking to. 
Trying so hard to roll fresh eyes back into my skull. Making friends out of 
paper, taped together only to come apart from being dragged through the wind. 
The grip of your young, young, young hand holding much stronger than scotch. 
14 years later, you can’t grip your friends the same. I learn to find 
the sky’s recognizing eyes.

        <h3>November 17</h3>

        <p> I was once sitting on California curbs and waking up in unmade <a href="love.html">beds that aren’t mine.</a> I lived in your home briefly. <br>
            I sink into my bed and feel your couch. <br>
            We loved to argue and we were always right. I taste you in my tea 
            even though you drink your coffee black. <br>
            You’re a church service. </p>
            <p>I would sit on your kitchen floor <br>
                I would study the geography of our bodies endlessly if you let me.
                </p>
            <p>Please don’t call. I’m not sure of your cruelty.<br> 
                I hear my phone ringing even when it’s on silent, I answer and there’s a few beats of Just breath and you say <br> 
                “You answered”, and I say, “you called” </p>
            <p>or maybe it's reversed</p>
            <p>Breadth turns to depth and once again:<br>
                I’m laughing with my back against your wall. <br>
                You vomited your guts out and I stayed and then I left.</p>
            <p>I just did two nights ago, it got all over the sleeves of my sweater: the bass churned it out of my chest. I spit up into my cup and into my hands and I threw up blood into the toilet. </p>
            <p>On the third trip I made to retch up my own mass I was silently given a bottle of water by the nicest man I’d ever met.</p>
            <p>I was forced into bars and onto my hands and knees and I couldn’t stop grinning<br>
                It was a beautiful night. <br>
                I’m losing your kindness. Please just call.</p>

                dream @ 5:40 am: <br>
                Scooping out the inside of bell peppers with the nail of my right thumb.

            <h3>October 19; 2 days before my 21st birthday</h3>
            <p>There’s a stillness in my gut.<br>
                A lonely sea, glittering with my own shadows.<br><br>
                
                I’ve been flattened into just light, idly watching the rolling waves.<br><br>
                
                Separated from my own wholeness. Desperate for earnest faith. <br><br>
                
                
                Flowers and worms and ants and crickets and fish evolved alongside humans<br>
                Their languages, just as deep <br>
                Their songs, just as sweet <br>
                Pulled by the same moon, aglow under the same stars. <br>
                Inspiring their own stories, with their own traceable breaths

                    <h4>Alternatively: Sword Swallower;</h4>
                    <h5>Or: My dad owned a green volvo</h5>
                <pre>
Lana Del Rey said hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like
me to have. I’m the dog curled up under your porch. My tail 
wags when I feel the beats of your steps against rotting 
floorboards, phasing past my head. I can’t help but wait, 
hidden from the rain, waiting for your movement, for proof of 
you breathing my same air-- whether you need to rake the yard or 
take out the trash. I’m not sure whether you’ve moved out—maybe 
the mildew, cobwebs, and mud will bring me new comfort. But I 
sit like a dog, mistaking mold for your company, convincing myself 
that like a dog needs its man, a man needs his dog. 

I don’t know if I’m a mean dog. 
I bite at your heels.  
I’m sorry.

I want to get drunk so I can hold a man’s hand but then it 
loses its place and I don’t want to be drunk anymore. I like 
slurring my words: it feels softer on my palette, gentler up my 
throat, halving the truth of my aching desperation. Bubbling laughter 
spills out my gut, I’m a selfish, selfish <s>girl</s> woman. I want to be 
loved and liked and seen but I’m freezing. I really do feel like a dog. 
You tied me to a fencepost and drove your Toyota into the eye of the 
hurricane. Or was it a Volvo? (I know it was a Toyota) 

I wait kindly; I am very gullible. 

My eyes dilate when I meet a mirror, just as they had when I’d sit 
across from you. There is unfortunately a fountain of hope rooted 
in my chest.  Nothing will ever feel like it once did but the dog 
in me tells me it could be better. The dog sleeping in the crate 
of my ribs tells me that above all I must stick it out– I must 
hope. Please jerk my leash.

                <h3>January 1 (Happy New Year)</h3>
                <p>I ask the moon if we’re fragments of the same exploded star<br>
                    I’m buzzing for my other half<br>
                    I gulp down moonlight <br><br>
                    
                    I toss my head back, hitting the too-low headrest <br> 
                    They whisper over the music ahead of me <br>
                    I don’t care to listen, choosing to trace the passing streams of light <br>
                    It’s past my bedtime<br> <br>
                    
                    I missed your funeral because you were buried in her bed <br>
                    I don’t think you even made it. <br> <br>
                    
                    My chest is it’s own fading star, crushing me in its own impacted mass <br>
                    I stopped crying over it all months ago <br>
                    I can’t seem to cry anymore, only cinematic and pretentious sighs <br>
                    Maybe I just want the mauve attention or some aching recognition <br> <br>
                    
                    This Honda feels like a confessional booth <br>
                    I’m slumped so low, my knees could hit the floor <br>
                    In some roundabout way </p>

                    <h3> January 16</h3>
                    <p>
                        Something creeps through the cracked window <br>
                        Just like me into your bed, hugging humming vents, <br> 
                        They squeak under your weight <br> <br>

                        The beads of light, gently tracing, from the corners of your eyelids, to the sway of your back <br>
                        I’d peel you like an orange, fingertips would graze over the dimpled skin, <br>
                        Dig my finger into the grooves. I wouldn’t be able to get the smell out from under my nails. <br>
                        To breathe you in, such a delicious comfort, of sun bathed oranges, peeking behind my childhood window <br>
                        Abundance litters the mossen ground, deep and dark. Exchanged exhales, <br>
                        <em>I sink</em> <br> <br>

                        You’re a deep green sea glass, a crashing wave, a northeastern lighthouse. <br>
                        The curling spine of the dead gull <br>
                        I didn’t pick it clean, I didn’t tuck it into my lace pocket, the sun was warm enough. <br>
                        It lay with its creator’s feathers, etched into smooth sand, undisturbed beyond my own footsteps <br>
                        Crinkled and wet and sticky, I could thumb the grooves of each bone if I’d wished <br>
                        The gull rests undisturbed, coiled and curved, I’d assume a struggle, knotted in its own fibers. <br>
                        The ocean air holds your hand. No more deep breaths for my tattered gull. <br>
                        No beautiful ceremony, but it lays in endless worship <br>
                        The devotion of a knowing gaze, the love to let it rest, <br>
                        <em>Oh.</em> <br>
                        How badly I wished to hold that gull <br>

                    <p>Early January<br>
                        I’m shaking the snow off my fur <br>
                        And watching my fattening body dance in my childhood mirror  <br> <br>
                        
                        
                        <em>Casually and Coyly</em> <br>
                        Would I want this? Do I ask? <br>
                        I only see myself through someone else’s eyes. <br> <br>
                        
                        Someone inside me would yelp or hiss <br>
                        Something inside wilts away <br>
                        Maybe this is just what life is now <br>
                        I don’t know what to do instead <br> <br>
                        
                        We played piano together, <br>
                        That is to say, <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He reminded me of the first 10 notes of Für Elise <br> <br>
                        
                        The song my mother taught me when I first learned to play

                        <h3> November 9 (365)</h3>
                        <p>There was a wildfire, and all the air smelled like home.<br>
                            I think you might be <s>my</s> a wildfire

                            <p>
                                I grasp onto roots and grass and dirt, undressing in the sun and watching the waves. I sat on some rocks, watching the Hudson river pull in and out, waves sparce and low, and a big black dog was playing fetch. And in the moment: I felt whole. I know that’s not poetic, but as much as I wish it was, the regular, fulfilling moments of life are not poetic. Not at face value, and if face value is enough to fill me then I choose to enjoy the birds in the sky and the city in front of me without ascribing lengthy prose to their wetted feathers or delayed traffic lights.
                            </p>
                            <p>There are brief moments when the world is gently wrapped around me. And my tunneled life widens and broadens, and I’m still me, and I’m still limited behind my own eyes, <strong>but my finger tips can graze yours and I can feel the friction of your atoms against mine.</strong></p>
