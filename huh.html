        <p>I think I have a mechanical bull instead of a heart. It creaks and rattles. I can’t stay upright. <br>
            I need to find a train, an iron horse <br>
            Where I can feel its beating heart, linked to my own <br>
            Like brothers swapping blood <br>
            Incinerator engine, swallowing coal. <br> <br> 
            
            Larger than life, rusted, wiry, and heavy. The tracks might eat me if I’m not careful. <br> 
            I’d leave my car by the crossing, and I’d remember it with tears in my eyes.<br> <br> 
            
            Rumbling roaring <br> 
                Against fingertips <br> 
                And Shaking Palms <br> <br> 
            
            I’m in love with some<br> 
            Those wider than my view, out of my perspective <br> 
            I collect nails in my heels. <br> <br> 
            
            A monster of metal, almost ancestral<br> 
            Carrying me under glittering stars, re-introducing us every night.<br> <br> 
            
            I’m a contemporary cowboy; desperately afraid of taking the reins <br> 
            Maybe I’m pathetic<br> <br> 
            
            My boots succumb to dry rot<br> 
            My memory too.<br> <br> 
            
            Can you carry me across a country?<br>

            <p>I don’t want a boyfriend and I don’t want a girlfriend <br>
                I want the angel that hangs above The Lovers tattooed on my lower back <br>
                Or the base of my neck. <br>
                Or between my breasts.<br><br>
                
                I might be hopeless, I might be a romantic <br><br>
                
                I read Shakespeare in high school and never cared for it<br>
                Only the frilled collar. <br>
                Or the theatrics of a stage<br>
                Maybe that’s all I’m meant to be. <br><br>
                
                I forgot how to play the piano and my fingers weather from regret<br><br>
                
                Me? <br>
                I don’t care much. </p>

                <h3>Humming</h3>
                <p>Who has faith in me? I have a need to be mythic <br>
                     <br>
                    Like the beads of sand– of tenderness– and impossibility: <br>
                    Falling through clenched fists<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like lies told by a roadside palm reader</p>
